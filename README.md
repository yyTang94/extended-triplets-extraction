# extended-triplets-extraction

This is the repository of paper "An Extended Sequence Labeling Approach For Relation Extraction".

- baseline is Basic-SL-A; baseline-better is Basic-SL-B; nomc is Extended-SL
- use uncased-baseline to tune hyper-parameters
- etype-* add the entity type information
- preprocess is to deal with the raw data
- construct is to produce triples by algorithms
